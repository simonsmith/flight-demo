# Flight demo
A tiny demo application mainly to show how flight components can be setup with RequireJS and tested with Jasmine. Touches on the common requirement of fetching some JSON and rendering it.

I found the Twitter Flight demo to be great, but a little overwhelming to first time users of the library.

It will also be used to accompany a couple of blog posts discussing my findings as I've just started using Flight on a work project.
