# Flight demo
A tiny demo application mainly to show how flight components can be tested. In particular, how to fake an Ajax success event with Jasmine spies.

Also ideal as a base for RequireJS config

It will be used to accompany a couple of blog posts discussing my findings as I've just started using Flight on a work project.
